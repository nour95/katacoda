This tutorial will give you an introduction to Docker! But before we begin, what is Docker? Docker is a platform that allows developers to build, deploy and manage containerized applications. As this is a tuturial aimed at beginners, the concept of containers might not be obvious at first, so a short explanation is warrented. Containers are a way of packaging up code and all of its dependencies so that the application can be deployed as one package, avoiding incompatibility issues between different envirmonments. 

The container technology is often compared to VM:s, which offer similar services. Containers are more lightweight however, since they don't carry its own instance of a guest operating system,unlike VM:s. This makes them valueable from a devops perspective, as the ease deployment, provision and restart makes them perfect for CI/CD pipelines.
