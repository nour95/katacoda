# Some basic commands

We can see all the containers that had been installed in your system, you can run:
```bash
docker ps -a
```


`docker`{{copy}} // good for the vim thing

`echo "Run in T1"`{{execute T1}}

<pre>`echo "Run in T3"`{{execute T1}}</pre>


Since we haven't installed any container yet, we will see that the list is empty
