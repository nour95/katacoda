# katacoda

Friendly url = the name of the folder of this scenario

- in two terminal mode, I didn't succeed to write any thing in the second terminal, so?

- katacoda scenarios:create

- To create a scenario:
katacoda scenarios:create


# some good commands to know when using katacoda (write in README files):

- To execute in terminal one
`echo "Run in T1"`{{execute T1}}


- To execute in terminal two (even if the terminal 2 is nt open):
`echo "Run in T2"`{{execute T2}}

- if the terminal where we run the code in sot important (will run in the terminal that is open right now):
`echo "No Terminal Defined"`{{execute}}


- To copy the code to the clipboard (like if we want the user to copy things to write it in vim later):
`docker`{{copy}}
